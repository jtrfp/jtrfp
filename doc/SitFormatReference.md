# Reference for the MTM SIT file format

*All information here is to my best knowledge, is is not proven by any official reference manual by Microsoft or [Terminal Reality](TerminalReality.md).

SIT files are simple line based text files used for describing a world.

## Description

The first line refers to a LVL file, which is the geometric description of the world. The SIT file itself contains further information on the track displayed in the game UI, the placing of models and the circuits.
